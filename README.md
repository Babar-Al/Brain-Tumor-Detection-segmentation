# Brain-Tumor-Detection-segmentation
This project focuses on Brain Tumor Detection using deep learning. It combines image classification to identify whether an MRI image contains a tumor and segmentation to locate and outline the tumor using a Mask R-CNN model. The project includes a custom-trained CNN classifier and a Mask R-CNN segmentation model applied to MRI scan images.
